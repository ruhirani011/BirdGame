It's a Web Based Application and the purpose of this game is to play and have fun. <br>
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

The idea of the game is to flap your bird through as many pipes as possible.<br>
The bird briefly flaps upward each time the player presses the key , if the key is not pressed, the bird falls due to gravity.<br>
