# Flappy_Bird

A Flappy Bird game made using <strong>Javascript</strong>.
It's a Web Based Application made to play and have fun. <br>
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

The idea of the game is to flap your bird through as many pipes as possible.<br>
The bird briefly flaps upward each time the player presses the key , if the key is not pressed, the bird falls due to gravity.<br>
So, Help the bird to flutter and get as far as possible. # avoid obstacles. #
